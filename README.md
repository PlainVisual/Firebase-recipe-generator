## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd fridgefeast
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI Studio API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY
    ```
    You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Genkit development server (for AI flows):**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, to watch for changes in your AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will typically start the Genkit server on `http://localhost:4500` (or as configured).

2.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    In a separate terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

Now you can open `http://localhost:9002` (or your configured port) in your browser to see the application running.

## ü§ñ AI Functionality

The application leverages Genkit to interact with Google's Gemini AI models for its core features:

1.  **Recipe Suggestion (`src/ai/flows/suggest-recipe.ts`):**
    *   Takes a comma-separated string of ingredients as input.
    *   Uses a Gemini model to generate a list of recipes, including names, ingredients, instructions, substitutions, and side dishes.
    *   Outputs structured JSON.

2.  **Recipe Image Generation (`src/ai/flows/generate-recipe-image-flow.ts`):**
    *   Takes the recipe name and key ingredients as input.
    *   Uses the `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model to generate an image.
    *   Returns the image as a data URI.

The Genkit flows are defined as server-side TypeScript functions and are invoked from the Next.js client components.
